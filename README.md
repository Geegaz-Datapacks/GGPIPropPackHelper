# GGPI prop pack helper
A helper app for GGPI, including a template pack. Check out the **[GGPI datapack](https://github.com/geegaz/GGPI/releases)** to place your props in the world.

> GGPI prop pack helper was coded with Python 3.9, and so requires you to have Python installed to work. If you don't have Python installed, check out [how to create props manually](#create-a-prop-manually).
